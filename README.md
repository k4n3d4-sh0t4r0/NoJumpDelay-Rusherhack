Set the delay between jumps when holding space key

# Settings

You can choose the delay between 0 and 20 ticks. The minecraft default value is 10

By default the delay is set to 0 so you will jump as soon as you touch the ground. Usefull if you want to go fast in a 2 blocks tall tunnel

You can climb staircase about 2 times faster if you set the delay to 3 and hold the jump button when climbing
